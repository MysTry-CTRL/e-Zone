# e-Zone 📚✨

A playful futuristic ebook platform (Bangla + English) powered by **Firebase Auth + Firestore**.

## What This Project Uses 🚀
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript (no custom backend)
- Firebase Authentication
- Cloud Firestore for live data sync
- Responsive UI for mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop

## Latest Update Log ✅ (2026-03-27)
### UI / Layout 🎨
- Fixed inconsistent spacing between cards/cells so sections look cleaner and less cramped.
- Added stronger shared spacing rules for category grids, discovery lists, and upload lists.
- Moved **Uploaded Books** search/filter controls to appear **above** the uploaded books list.

### Hover / Footer 🦶✨
- Stabilized footer hover behavior by isolating footer links from the global hover transform stack.
- Reduced footer hover conflicts that caused jitter/jumpy animation.

### Mobile Topbar + Access 📱
- Mobile compact menu now includes missing account controls for logged-in users.
- Mobile menu now guarantees **Login** and **Sign Up** links for guests.
- Added mobile action entries:
  - `My Account`
  - `Theme Toggle` (logged-in only)
  - `Notifications`

### Theme Rules 🌗
- Theme pill toggle is now rendered only for authenticated users.
- Guests no longer see theme toggle until login/signup is completed.

### Owner Update Notifications 🔔
- Added a universal notification button in the header control area.
- Notifications read from Firestore collection: `ownerUpdates`.
- Added **Owner Updates modal** to show recent owner announcements.
- Added owner publish form on `dashboard.html`:
  - `Update Title`
  - `Update Message`
  - Saves directly to Firestore and updates notification feed.

## Firestore Collections 🧠
- `users`
- `admins`
- `books`
- `feedback`
- `ownerUpdates` ✨ (new)

## Important Security Note 🔐
- Owner credentials are fixed in app logic and must remain hidden from public UI.
- Keep sensitive account details out of public docs/screenshots.
